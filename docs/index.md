## Hiking apps

There is no universal hiking app that is good for everything. All have some regions
with great coverage and some regions with less coverage. Both pricing and content of the
premium offerings are very different.

Services like strava that are more to keep track of your hikes are not listed.

-   [Wandelknooppunt](https://www.wandelknooppunt.be/): Web site and app to navigate along 
    hiking networks in Flanders. In 2023 some virtual networks in Flanders and Wallonia 
    were also added, as are networks in the Netherlands and parts of Germany and France.

    [NodeMapp](https://www.nodemapp.com/) is the English version.

-   [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/)

-   [WikiLoc](https://www.wikiloc.com/) is one of the cheaper ones but also with a more
    primitive feeling. However, as it is cheap, it has decent covereage in many countries.

-   [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/)

-   [RouteYou](https://www.routeyou.com/). One of the problems with this site is that they
    have too many types of similar activities, and you have to filter to a specific one
    or not filter at all.

-   [OutdoorActive](https://www.outdooractive.com/)

Just for the maps, I use [Guru Maps](https://gurumaps.app/)
which offers the maps from [OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
that are fine for hiking in many areas.
